## Description
In this project I carefully crafted a full-stack application customised to create a community among gamers and those alike. 

My platform aims to provide an accessible sense of freedom to vocalise thoughts and opinions within the gaming community. Whether you’re new or a veteran to the gaming world, I aim to provide players with easy access to informative posts and reviews of various games.

My motivation is to provide an accessible, friendly and casual platform for gamers. 

My Aim:
• Ensure any type of player finds my platform easy to navigate, as I created the visual appeal with the user in mind.
• Allowing users to have a sense of security logging into my platform and enjoy participating with my custom community based design.
• A place for all players in the gaming world to be involved in, having the option to talk about any games. 
• Enhanced engagement through my active community.
